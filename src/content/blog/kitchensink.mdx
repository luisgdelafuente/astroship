import Button from "@/components/ui/button.astro";

Welcome to a demo post about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**! This post is written in `.mdx`, so we can use Astro components and interactive elements right inside our content.

## What is AI?

AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It powers technologies like chatbots, recommendation engines, and self-driving cars.

<Button href="https://openai.com" target="_blank">Learn More About AI</Button>

## Example: Simple AI Code

Here's a Python snippet that uses a mock AI model to generate text:

```python
def generate_text(prompt):
    # Imagine this calls a real AI model
    return f"AI says: {prompt[::-1]}"

print(generate_text("Hello, world!"))
```

## Why Use .mdx for AI Blog Posts?

- Embed interactive components (like the button above)
- Display code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Mix Markdown and Astro/React/Vue components

## Try It Out

You can add more components, like custom alerts, charts, or even live code editors, to make your AI blog posts more engaging!

This is just a demo. Replace this content with your own AI insights and interactive elements!
