## Fun Fact

> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College.

## Example: AI-Powered Recommendation (JavaScript)

```js
function recommend(productList, userPreferences) {
  // Mock recommendation logic
  return productList.filter(p => userPreferences.includes(p.category));
}

const products = [
  { name: 'Smart Speaker', category: 'tech' },
  { name: 'Yoga Mat', category: 'fitness' },
];

const recommendations = recommend(products, ['tech']);
console.log(recommendations);
```

## Why .mdx?

- Use components for CTAs
- Add interactivity
- Mix Markdown and UI elements
